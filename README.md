# React-Calculator

Hello and welcome to my calculator made with React Hooks! The concept and functionality are based off of the Calculator app that comes standard with the iPhone at factory settings.


## Notable Features

- Will solve basic calculations after clicking the equal sign.
- Will solve calculations without the equals button when additional operators are used (ex: "1+2*" --> "3*5-" --> "15-7" . . .)
- AC button allows to reset screen to 0.
- Plus/Minus button changes integer from positive to negative and vice-versa
- Percentage button divides integer by 100
- Debug View toggle feature gives full display of equations used
