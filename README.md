Hello and welcome to my calculator made with React Hooks! The concept and functionality are based off of the Calculator app that comes standard with the iPhone at factory settings.


## Notable Features

- Will solve basic calculations after click the equal signs.
- Will solve calculations without the equals button when other. operators are used (ex: "1+2" --> "3*5" --> "15-7" . . .).
- AC button allows to reset screen to 0.
